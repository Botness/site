# Bot Character Design

## Topics
* demographics/verticals differences for bots — casual interaction vs transactional
* exact control vs generative conversations
* scripted vs generative
* multiple personas for a single bot?
* “personalization” a la Samantha in Her
* Bot introduction/onboarding/orientation
* existing talent vs new talent — are existing writers equipped to succeed
* engagement / re-engagement hooks / creating appeal
* FAQ bots are challenging because they will tell a story
* markers in text-based communication for enhancing the way bots respond
	* typing indicator (i.e. how long someone is typing)
	* responsiveness of respondent
	* keyword density could be inverse to casual
	* platform/linguistic registers
		* people speak differently in different contexts
	* VCs pretend to be kids to test out character bots — but kids will actually talk and talk talk… so the bot could just pick ONE topic from the kids “verbal utterance” to dive into
	* people clarify their thinking through speaking out loud… over time. how should bots deal with that?
