## What do startups/devs/enterprises want?
*Participants representing various start-ups shared what they wanted to hear from platforms, collected below and organized by topic.*

* Auth/installations
	* Inconsistency with authentication & installing bots across platforms
* UI
	* Consistent language across platforms to describe UI features would be great
* Security & policy
	* Huge problem with privacy and not totally understanding what happens to data consumers share with bots
	* How do we bring start-ups into the Enterprise space? What about compliance?
		* One way of thinking about this: Messenger/Slack are user acquisition channels, and then bringing users to compliant apps later
	* Limited encryption for conversational platforms
* Customer learnings
	* How might startups share what we know about customer behavior to platforms?
	* How do platform teams think about their enterprise and consumer customers? Similarities, differences.
		* This would help the startup founder to decide which platforms to support and build on
* Bot metrics & business support
	* Ads, payments: some platforms are very opaque about monetization. How do platforms set expectations with start-ups attempting to build businesses on platforms?
	* Metrics: Data representation across all of the platforms is very different, and it would be great to have conventions around similar schema to represent users or other objects

*People also provided ideas for next steps.*
* Working sessions to report to platforms information about health of business and actual company needs
* What can we do to organize our community for the future?
