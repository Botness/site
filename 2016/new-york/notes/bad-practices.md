Notes by [Lars Liden](https://twitter.com/larsliden)

* Ignoring human inputs.  
	* If user uploads image – bot doesn’t respond.  Or user says something but doesn’t expect.
* Overly responsive bot
	* In group conversation bot should respond to everything
* Not taking advantage of affordances of platform 
	* Sending YouTube link rather than embedding video
* Encouraging chit chat
	* Bot seems more intelligent than it is, encourages real conversation that bot can’t support
	* Be really focused or really smart (hard)
* Saying same thing again and again
	* Humans don’t do this (add some randomization)
* Failure to think about what scenarios are appropriate for bots
	* Converting existing website into a bot
	* Pivoting existing content in to a bot doesn’t work
	* Browsing doesn’t work well, tech is not there yet 
* Over indexing on NLP
	* Form filling not easier on chat, buttons are better
* Dead ends (state machine) – user gets lost
* Amnesia
	* Forgetting information that the bot should know
* No onboarding
	* Need to explain what the bot can do so not a blank box
* Failure to do user experience testing
	* Figure out where users actually get stuck, what they type
* Failure to provide clarity on privacy boundaries, what data is shared
Open issues:
* Gender – yes or no?
	* Some languages require gender to have a conversation 
* Personality
	* Very cultural / business vertical specific
