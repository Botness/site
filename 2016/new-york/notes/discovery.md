# Discovery

* IS IT REALLY ABOUT THE BOT STORE?
* Twitter is actually a place for bots to be found, bots can _find_ you because the conversations happen in public
* As laura from kik said, being in group conversations is key. In the future, will Facebook group convos allow bot?  I HOPE SO. This also provides social proof and education - you see other people using it, etc
* Persistence in visibility. Where are my bots? Need a place for bots to live in the UI of the messenger.
* We are in the Yahoo portal days of bots - hand curated lists.
* In defense of a bot shop: there needs to be a very easy way to find bots, scroll through and browse them etc.  Billions of people use app stores.
* Bot stores also give a bit of safety. It's got reviews. You can see who made it. You can see that other people used it.
* Right now being featured in a bot store is killer.
* So user acquisition is one thing, but then there is another chunk of users that the bot can reach by social spread/recommendations/sharing
* Is there something to learn from things like NPM or Python libraries? You have a thing you need to do and you just kinda try to install it by keyword.  You can sort of explore and see ratings, use, etc.
* GOD BOTS that know about other bots and find you a bot to do the thing you need.  "I need a car" leads to some new bot being installed.
* Could the platforms do this more? Hey it looks like you could use a scheduler bot!
* Could bot discovery be totally social? Like, sometimes you talk to a person and sometimes you are talking to their bots.
* Maybe there is like a RPG inventory system where you can see someone's "upgrades" and adopt them yourself
