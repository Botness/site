Notes by [Ben Brown](https://twitter.com/benbrown)

* The whole [chat bot facebook group shenanigans](https://venturebeat.com/2016/11/04/chatbots-magazine-founder-accused-of-using-100-pitch-decks-from-bot-businesses-to-help-his-own-startup/) puts a bad taste in peoples mouths.
* How can we do stuff to actually help and curate the community?
* How do we broaden and grow this community? It has to grow A LOT
* [Chatbots.org](http://chatbots.org) is a large existing community with lots of experts.
* How can we bring the difference to communities together? What types of moderation is needed? What about spin off regional groups -- set the DNA and let people take it and use it in their own communities.  Who owns Botness?  Could this be _open sourced?_
* Open coffee style thing? [Paul Walsh](https://twitter.com/Paul__Walsh) and others are working on this.
* What is the community participation model for the different groups? Agencies, devs, platforms, press? On botness.org can we help people find the right place?
* Could botness become a bit more formalized coalition with a more defined public interest goal?
* Betaworks did botcamp.  They're doing more, trying to broaden the audience, bring in folks into mixed reality, VR
* Rachel from kip has been collaborating with others on design standards - not technical, but design oriented primitives.
* How can botness influence or direct the community?
* Bring the actual brands and customers into the conversation to talk to the platforms, toolmakers and devs.

* Advocacy
* Standards / Cross platform parity
* Community
* Best practices
* Technical Resources
* Baseline metrics that can be used to understand success

Two big things we could do:
* How to start, scale and monetize your bot business?
* How can someone in the community take action: reach out and connect with help
