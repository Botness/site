Notes by [Pete Skomoroch](https://twitter.com/peteskomoroch)

* The Google Assistant will be delegating user requests to recommended 3rd party bots like Uber, you can already do this manually on Alexa
* How will bots talking to bots be different from connecting web APIs?
* Does a bot 2 bot interaction have to be conversational? Can they communicate more efificiently than we can via natural language?
* Ticker tape example: apps and people post messages to a group chat or channel, other agents can read and act on the publicly posted messages
* In wall street automated trading now dominates, with high frequency bots powered by algorithms trading based on the prices and transactions they see.
* Ebay and Amazon have pricing and bidding bots
* Thington allows IoT bots to subscribe to other bots in a feed like twitter
* There may be some learnings to apply from sensors and hardware systems, model railroading industry has a standard that has worked really well for devices to communicate, see [CanBus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus)
* "Slack is working because the conversations are more observable. This works with humans but can work with bots as well."
* How do you handle cascading failures and backwards incompatible changes within bot abilities? In a complex chain of tasks, delegated between bots, one bad bot can break the chain.
* Will there be anti-trust issues if major platforms are deciding which bots fulfill requests and delegate to their own bots instead of 3rd party bots?
* Potentially a big efficiency gain by connecting many bots, reducing human coordination and communication costs.
* Lots of thinking and work to do around security questions. For bots to delegate to other bots they will need to send my personal information or send customer information to complete a transaction or purchase something.
* Slack: bots can't open a direct message to other bots, they can only act independently on broadcast messages they see in public channels. Bots can't push buttons or fill in forms or text fields.
* How do you auth in more than 1 party in an API integration?
* Bots can't install eachother in Slack or FB
* Can you invoke a swarm of bots to accomplish a task?
* Who installs a set of bots, and can you use your friends bots?
* There should be a less noisey view of public chatter for humans, but you should be able to "crack the hood" of the car to see all the bot chatter and communication.
