Notes by Rachel Law

* Provocative topics:
* → chris on whiteboard
* → demographics and characters
	* multiple vs one
	* exact control vs vague language
	* scripted vs off the cuff vs generative dialogue
	* one bot = multiple personas?
	* personalization? → usa bot example, Samantha
	* how do you know the bot, how do you do onboarding, how to do bot introductions?
		* bots with similar social profiles?
	* new class of creative? Transference vs new talent
	* problem solving vs narrative driven → seek out bot for solution vs seek out bot for conversation
* how does character interact with solution needs - orientation/spectrum/casual/transactional
* engagement/re-engagement/appeal

When we meet new people → first spin class
Intro I have vs Uber driver and Spin class (dumped twice) Humans do a thing vs human and bot interaction Handshake meeting
15-20 seconds ---> body posture
Chatroom or phonecall
Full fidelity
Only audio or text
Intros only happen that way

Intros in textroom is similar to meeting friends in a chatroom

Definitely start from what we know
Not necessarily human to human is optimal
So much context in situation that sets expectations Ideally you have as much context
If you call up IRS then you have context of calling IRS Whole lot of context---> same for banking bot
More specialized context bot with very clear intent

Another spin class
Type of personality → I may want a really short interaction Not the same for every user

How long to expect a conversation i.e. instruction Or finding the least common denominator

Find micro-engagements
Meet someone in a bar
Not trying to marry them in 15mins

Think it’s dangerous to assume people don’t want to interact Best engagements are active
Very strong voice and personality
Write editorial
All the best interactions are from people going way too far Those are the people who love using it

Mom example
Take cues in existing real time

Don’t know if there’s a cue
Assume default

Think about length of request
It’s because of bad experience that they do the short lang.
If they actually have good experience then they understand they can build complex queries Type of information given by user is more
Italian soho restaurant cheap wine to confront with partner with affair

Nth request vs first request
Totally different expectation
Text has tones of markers vs voice-audio So much more to play in messaging Technical problem easier in messaging

If they didn’t think it was a human they wouldn’t have

Faq bots are so challenging
People say this to bots too
When someone has a problem they will tell a story

Bot that people send gifts
Professional gifts
Hand delivery vs shipping
Some people love messenger some people just want drop off

Sales gifts where it was not accepted as hand delivery “Are there any instructions” → just drop it off on my desk

Start training your bot according
In a team gift vs sales gift

Markers: additional questions, typing indicator, keyword map density, platform linguistic register Human-to-human chat
People don’t talk to humans the same way
The point is there are markers in text
Longer sentences and they overestimate your ability

Hello barbie for mattel
Adults who test out pretend to be kids
Give to kid they have 18 sentences to match now
As long as you picked a thematic utterance
Doesn’t need to understand the entire paragraphs
In casual conversation flows psuedo-linearly
Goes with the last part of the paragraph

We as humans pick up one thing and go down the wave
Google assistant creating convo threads
Stream of consciousness parsing (Pana bot)
Depending on the service of this bot --- the bot will listen and retain everything compared to a human
The way we create meaning is progressively
Forming thoughts as you are speaking Need more time to express time
Theory of mind vs machines aren’t
New language?
Trained us to speak google-speak
It transfers, not necessarily only good at

Do things humans are not good at
Just tracking how much people talk in a convo Have a facilitator --- we are not going that
* Language evolved --- natural language will evolve from siri and google
* People do ask multi dimension questions, no cleric ever answers in sync. Humans can’t handle 3 questions. It’s not in group’s interest to multi thread
* Delays -- overlapping synchronicity: neither async nor sync
* Know your user
